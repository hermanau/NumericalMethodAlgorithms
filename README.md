## NumericalMethodAlgorithms
These functions are created with the intention of performing various forms of numerical methods on some
set of data that has been input into the function.  

### Folder Summaries
- Array Factorization
  - Decomposes arrays so that they may be analyzed more efficiently and effectively.
- Integration Techniques
  - Numerically integrates values for data points that cannot be integrated analytically.
- Root Finding Methods
  - Find a root (intersection with zero) for a provided function utilizing various open and closed 
  methods.
  
### Existing Function Summaries
- luFactor performs a lower upper factorization on an input array.  This is useful in many calculations 
involving systems of equations that have been put in array form.
- falsePosition uses the iterative false position method to arrive at a root for a supplied equation
on a given interval.
- Simpson integrates a set of data (vector of independent values, vector of dependent values) utilizing 
Simpson's 1/3 rule and a trapezoid calculation if need be.
