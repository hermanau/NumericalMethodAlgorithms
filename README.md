## NumericalMethodAlgorithms
These functions are created with the intention of performing various forms of numerical methods on some
set of data that has been input into the function.  

### Function Summaries
-luFactor performs a lower upper factorization on an input array.  This is useful in many calculations 
involving systems of equations that have been put in array form.

-falsePosition uses the iterative false position method to arrive at a root for a supplied equation
on a given interval.

-Simpson integrates a set of data (vector of independent values, vector of dependent values) utilizing 
Simpson's 1/3 rule and a trapezoid calculation if need be.
